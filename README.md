Train a convolutional neural network to recognize the MNIST handwritten 
digits. 

**TODO**
1. Succesful training and testing of classifier indicating training and 
test accuracies. 
2. Live demo presenting capture and detection of handwritten digits.
3. **Extra Credit:** Live Demo presenting localization and 
identification of 
a handwritten digit that has been embedded in another image. 


**Results:** 
Training: Loss 0.0620, acccuracy: 98%
Testing: Loss: 0.03162, accuracy: 98.91%
